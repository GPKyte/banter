# Third day of Advent of Code

### Context

Given a even-length string of English letters representing a sack:
Split into two equal length left and right halves called compartments.
Then search for the one (or more?) letters which are shared in both halves.
At this point, report the sack's outlier, the item found in both compartments.
Total up the priority of all the outliers found in every sack.

a-zA-Z Have assigned values 1-52, priority increases with number, 'Z' being greatest, 'a' being least.
