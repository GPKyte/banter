Will model the movement of a rope onto a grid.
At the end will determine where the tail of the rope has landed.

The head of the rope moves Up, down, left, right
The tail of the rope remains still, or moves Up, down, left, right or diagonally up or down and left or right
The tail movement is a stepwise choice towards the closest radial point next to the rope.
The tail can be under the head.

The input determines the direction and distance of rope movement
To move the rope once in a direction
Determine whether the tail is in the (up to) nine grid spaces.
If so move the head and not the tail
If not, the tail will assume the heads position as the head assumes the next position.

The grid is in a good place to recall and present the positions visited by the tail, and to record the position of the two rope ends.
A string method on the rope may be unuseful here,
But a variety of string methods may be useful in development of the grid

The grid will maintain data about the history of the rope tail's positions
The grid will maintain the head and tail positions of the rope
The grid will display the entire bounds of the grid with the above data distinguished.

The movements of the rope must be parsed from IO in their shortform.
The grid will implement methods for moving the rope head and tail aligned with the input options.
